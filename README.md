# Covid-19_Data_Analysis
This is COVID-19 Data Exploration and Analysis project using SQL.
I used the analysed data to create the COVID-19 Data Analysis dashboard in TABLEAU!

The dashboard portrays an analysis of covid-19 data from 1/1/2020 to 5/1/2021. It represents continent wise total deaths and full vaccinated people, deaths per country, total cases, total deaths and death percentage. It also shows the percentage of infected people and its forecast.

I used SQL Server Management Studio for Data Analysis & Exploration and Tableau for Dashboard modelling.
